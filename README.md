# hello-world

This is the fist day I begin to use Github. I know there are lots of factastic projects stored in the Github. I love coding and is woking on it. There will be a REAL project rather than "hello-world" in the near future.

O, what's more, I 'm not a native English speaker, and if there are any mistakes with my English please ignore it :>

That's it.
